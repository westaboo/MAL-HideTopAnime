# MAL-Filter

Filter out anime from MyAnimeList's top anime page.

For now, the extension only filters out Gintama. You can change this and edit it to whatever you would like. Simply add the lines to main.js, following the template below.

```javascript
to_remove.add(NAME_OF_ANIME);
```

You won't have to do the above for long. I am working on adding a user interface to add custom anime titles.
